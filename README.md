# Sole-Purpose-Business-Insights
Knowing that I was going to be joining the professional job world in the coming years, I wanted to find ways to decrease the time I spent in my business, Sole Purpose. I was looking for the highest profit margin I could achieve with as little time as possible, so I did a stastical analysis on the profitability of my previous sales based on what platform I sold on. What I found was that when selling direct-to-consumer, my profit margin was much higher than other sites like eBay. I decided to make a change to my business and create more automated marketing efforts that targeted my personal network. This analysis was done to see whether or not my efforts were fruitful, and if my profit margin increased because of this change.
